Four case studies were considered to explain how Robust Optimization techniques could be implemented in real life engineering optimization problems.
a)	An out-of-plane loading problem where volume of the frame has to be minimized with stress and size limitations as constraints and uncertainty in the load applied.
b)	A spring-mass-damper system where the maximum acceleration of the system over a period of 10 seconds (subjected to an initial velocity) has to be minimized. Uncertainty in the mass of the system and the initial velocity provided.
c)	A reactor separator system with uncertain reaction rates.
d)	And the classic Golinskiâ€™s speed reducer problem with uncertainty in the power transmitted and pinion speed.
